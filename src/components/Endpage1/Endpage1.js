        The heat out there this evening
        is contained heat like things keep applicable boxes
        at the ready then subsume their diverging constituent parts
        long ambivalent talks into midnight, all those
        glowy Sophia Coppola movies, Prosecco
        the sexiest records I know. I don’t feel
        how I know anymore to be more than something seeking
        my appalling lack of cinematic knowledge, fictive innocence
        & something like the break-down of those little boxes
        little tombs put their hands up in front of my mouth
        there’s a tacitly humiliating eulogy to drown out couldn’t feel
        much more stupid about feeling stupid over feeling
        stupid, living. Let me go & watch something
        moving several images some of them symbolize humility broken
        postures bloodshot eyes, intimately talking through this
        publicly I am not developing at all but just the same…
