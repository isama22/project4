          <strong>The Glass Essay</strong><em>Anne Carson</em>

          I
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I can hear little clicks inside my dream.
          Night drips its silver tap
          down the back.
          At 4 A.M. I wake. Thinking
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          of the man who
          left in September.
          His name was Law.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My face in the bathroom mirror
          has white streaks down it.
          I rinse the face and return to bed.
          Tomorrow I am going to visit my mother.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          SHE
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          She lives on a moor in the north.
          She lives alone.
          Spring opens like a blade there.
