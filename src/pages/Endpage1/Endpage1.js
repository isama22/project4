      glowy Sophia Coppola movies, Prosecco
      the sexiest records I know. I don’t feel
      how I know anymore to be more than something seeking
      my appalling lack of cinematic knowledge, fictive innocence

      much more stupid about feeling stupid over feeling
      stupid, living. Let me go & watch something
      moving several images some of them symbolize humility broken
      postures bloodshot eyes, intimately talking through this
