        The Glass Essay
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        BY ANNE CARSON
        I
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I can hear little clicks inside my dream.
        Night drips its silver tap
        down the back.
        At 4 A.M. I wake. Thinking
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        of the man who
        left in September.
        His name was Law.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My face in the bathroom mirror
        has white streaks down it.
        I rinse the face and return to bed.
        Tomorrow I am going to visit my mother.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        SHE
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        She lives on a moor in the north.
        She lives alone.
        Spring opens like a blade there.
