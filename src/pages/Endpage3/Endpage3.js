        In Memory of My Heavy Metal Years

        There goes the
        aluminum, the antimony, the arsenic
        the barium, the cadmium, 
        the cesium, the gadolinium
        the lead
        the mercury
        the nickel, the thalium, and 
        the tin. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        There goes that job spraying lawns
        with chemicals, driving the Merc
        three-quarter ton 
        with a tank on the back
        and no brakes
        through West Vancouver, bouncing
        the wheels against the curb
        to stop
        and on the steep
        majesterial streets
        that afford such views

      </div>
